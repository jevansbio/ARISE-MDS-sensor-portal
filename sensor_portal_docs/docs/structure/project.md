# Project

A project represents a defined ecological or scientific effort under which data is collected. It includes contextual information such as goals, study area, team members, and time frames. Projects serve as containers for organizing related deployments and observations.

## SEARCH FUNCTION & FILTERS IN PROJECTS
A general search function and filters are available to subset **projects**.  

**Search** Accepted search functions include and are limited to the full, or parts of a site name. For example _Amsterdamse_ or _Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen_, or _AWD_.  

**Deployment active now?** Allows you to filter by _True_ for projects which are currently active, and _False_ for projects which are no longer active.  

**Select job** There are currently no job options to select at project level.

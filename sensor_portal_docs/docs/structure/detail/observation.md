### Methods

- **`__str__()`**: Returns the label of the observation.
- **`get_absolute_url()`**: Returns the URL of the first associated data file.
- **`get_label()`**: Generates a label from the taxon and file name.
- **`get_taxonomic_level(level)`**: Returns the Taxon at the specified level.
- **`save()`**: Sets label and observation date automatically.
- **`check_data_files_human()`**: Updates associated files if the taxon is human.

### Signals

- **`m2m_changed`**: Updates observation when its data files are modified.
- **`post_save`**: Re-checks `has_human` flag on save.
- **`post_delete`**: Re-checks `has_human` flag when deleted.

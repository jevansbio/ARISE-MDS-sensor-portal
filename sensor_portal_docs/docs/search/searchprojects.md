# SEARCH FUNCTION & FILTERS IN PROJECTS
A general search function and filters are available to subset **projects**.  

**Search** Accepted search functions include and are limited to the full, or parts of a site name. For example _Amsterdamse_ or _Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen_, or _AWD_.  

**Deployment active now?** Allows you to filter by _True_ for projects which are currently active, and _False_ for projects which are no longer active.  

**Select job** There are currently no job options to select at project level.
